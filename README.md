# Hi There! :smiley:

First off, thank you for taking the time to review my work, and for the opportunity with this challenge.

I enjoyed this little challenge and am excited to share it with you!

To view a live demo version of the site you can either:

- visit [Hosted Version Here](https://julia-johnson-vimeo-test.netlify.com/ "vimeo-test") -- Netlify
- Clone and download the Repository
  - navigate to the downloaded file
  - run `yarn add react` in your terminal
  - then `yarn start` to launch the app

I utilized React and Styled-Components to build this site. I was able to connect to the Vimeo API, but unfortunately, didn't recieve my authorization in time to replace the static content.
